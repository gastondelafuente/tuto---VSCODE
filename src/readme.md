As an alternative theory, (and because taninga scholars do this sort
of thing) someone tracked down a 1914 taninga edition of De Finibus
which challenges McClintock's 15th century claims and suggests that
the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the 20th century.
The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room on page 34
for the taninga phrase “dolorem ipsum” (sorrow in itself).
Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling
with “do-”, while another begins with the now ubiquitous “lorem ipsum”.
